## Production Background
I have a strong interest in `Gamification`.<br>
<br>
In fact, it's not just an interest, it's a dream and one of my life goals to become well-known in this field. <br>
<br>
I have loved games since I was young.<br>
<br>
Many people have a negative perception of games, <br>
<br>
But I am convinced that I have gained many positive aspects in life through games.<br>
<br>
Through the raid leader activity in a game called 'World of Warcraft', I was able to develop strong social skills and leadership.<br>
<br>
From a game called 'League of Legends', I learned about the harm of excessive competition and how deeply people can immerse themselves in the element of 'competition'.<br>
<br>
From a case of a game called 'Heroes of the Storm', which is of the same genre as 'League of Legends' but failed at the box office, I learned about the drawbacks of 'communism'<br>
<br>
Beyond these well-known games, I've truly been able to learn a lot of life-helping lessons through a diverse array of games.<br>
<br>
>Of course, it's not true that all aspects of games are positive.<br>
<br>
There are certainly negative aspects to games.<br>
<br>
However, I believe that the causes of these negative elements lie more in the other aspects that inevitably draw one into the game world, rather than in the 'game' itself.<br>
<br>
I think 'game addiction' is not a 'disease', but a 'symptom'.<br>
<br>
It's a 'symptom' that appears due to the real 'disease' caused by various problems.<br>
<br>
Because I have these thoughts, I think I'm very interested in 'Gamification'.<br>
<br>
I will deal with related stories separately in the future.<br>

<br><br>
Therefore, even if it's in a simple way, I wanted to create a game that actively applies 'Gamification'... <br>
<br><br><br>
To create a stepping stone for the growth I need...<br>
<br><br><br>
That game is `BOB - Basis Of Bitwise.` <br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
Firstly, the goal of making this game was to create a stepping stone.<br>
<br>
A stepping stone needed for me, who still lacks references in the field of gamification.<br>
<br>
Therefore, one of the things I considered most among various elements was the possibility of 'promotion'. <br>
<br><br><br>
In fact, I wanted to make a game based on topics I like or want to learn about. <br>
<br>
However, considering the production goal of this game, I chose the topic of 'bit operation'. <br>
<br>
<br>
At the time of production, and still now, I belong to a community called `42Seoul`, which is comprised of people who dream of becoming developers.<br>
<br>
In this community, there are about 2,000 members in the 42Seoul channel alone, and including 42Paris, 42Tokyo, etc., more than 100,000 people belong to channels worldwide.<br>
<br>
<b>I wanted to take advantage of this aspect.</b><br>
<br>
So, when considering the topic of the game, I prioritized the following:<br>
<br>
1. A topic that developers or aspiring developers would be interested in learning about<br>
2. A topic that aligns with my gamification philosophy of 'making unfamiliar things naturally enjoyable to learn'<br>
<br><br>

As a result of considering these points, I chose bit operation as the topic.<br>
<br>
Actually, I believe bit operation, being the most basic principle of computers, is not at all difficult once you become familiar with it.<br>
<br>
However, since many aspects of the development field have advanced, you can proceed with development relatively conveniently even if you don't know the principles.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, I believe that knowing the 'basic principles' of anything is very important.<br>
<br>
It's a concept too important to be excluded simply because it's 'hard to learn'.<br>
<br>
And in many aspects such as coding tests, algorithm solving, networking, setting item flags in games, bit operation becomes a great tool.<br>
<br>
But I, too, have had thoughts like 'Do I really need to learn this?', so I understand the difficulty of learning.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I wanted to help people overcome these obstacles and enable them to 'learn about bit operations in a fun and familiar way'.<br>
<br><br><br>
One of my favorite phrases related to learning is, `"It's not difficult, it's just unfamiliar."`<br>
<br>
As we live, we often have to learn new things. <br>
<br>
I believe that usually, learning new things is challenging because they are `'unfamiliar'`,<br>
<br>
but sometimes, people seem to think they are hard because they are `'difficult'`.<br>
<br><br><br>
Deep aspects of fields established as a discipline, such as physics, philosophy, mathematics, etc.,<br>

and fields that require art and a high degree of physical ability... I consider these to be truly 'difficult',<br>
<br>
and for ordinary people, many things such as memorizing multiplication tables, correct postures for fitness exercises, how to use new electronic devices, etc.,<br>
<br>
I believe the difficulty in learning them is not because they are `'difficult'`, but because they are `'unfamiliar'`.
<br>
<br><br><br>
As the era progresses, and thanks to the efforts of many wonderful people,<br>
<br>
the things that were difficult are gradually decreasing, and the things that are just unfamiliar are increasing.<br>
<br><br><br>
I also want to convey to people that <b>"many of the things they find hard to learn are just unfamiliar, and it's okay once they become familiar."</b><br>
<br><br><br><br>
Through the element of `'fun'`,<br>
<br><br><br><br>
And through the channel of `'games'`.<br>
<br><br>

## GameDesign
Since I was working on the development alone, the planning was just a matter of jotting things down in a notebook.<br>
<br>
Since I only wrote enough for me to understand, <br>

there's a really big barrier to conveying the planned content to others in this notebook.ðŸ¥²<br>

Although it's embarrassing, I'll reveal just a part of it.<br>

  <p align="center">

    <img src="/assets/images/slide_res/Design_gamePlaying_005.png" align="center" width="33%">
    <figcaption align="center">The notebook...(click to enlarge)</figcaption>
  </p>
<br>
Since I've already explained the biggest game designing intent in the production background above,<br>
<br>
I want to explain the other parts I focused on while game designing.<br>
<br><br><br>
Firstly, game resources.<br>
<br>
My drawing skills are really poor.<br>
<br>
So, my goal was to make a game that could be created with as simple drawings as possible.<br>
<br>
In fact, it's even awkward to call it 'drawing'.<br>
<br>
It's a little sad that this was one of the main focuses of the planning...<br>
<br><br><br>
The second focus was, 'how can one learn naturally while playing?' <br>
<br>
In other words, I tried my best to design it so that 'learning' itself is not the goal, but 'gameplay' itself becomes the goal, and 'learning' naturally occurs.<br>
<br>
For instance, unlike games named 'Q-Play' or 'QuizQuiz' that drive users' learning by 'posing and solving problems', <br>
<br>
I focused on planning the game in a way that learning about bitwise operations occurs naturally as one goes through the game process of matching blocks. <br>
<br><br><br>
The third thing was not to write the plan too detailed. <br>
<br>
Actually, this point could be a big disadvantage in case of collaboration, but as I was developing alone, there was an advantage that the plan didn't have to be detailed.<br>
<br>
I actively utilized this point, wrote down the overall big picture in the plan, and documented the remaining parts using GitHub issues as they came up.<br>
<br>
Thanks to this, the time spent on documentation significantly reduced.<br>
<br><br><br>
However, I only reduced the resources spent on 'documenting for conveying to others',<br>
<br>
I was very meticulous about 'documenting for myself, to check the progress of the project at every opportunity'.<br>
<br><br>

<br><br><br>

## Prototype
In fact, there were many prototypes. <br>
<br>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/images/slide_res/prototype_001.png" align="center" width="30%">
    <img src="/assets/images/slide_res/prototype_002.png" align="center" width="30%">
    <figcaption align="center">The first prototype</figcaption>
  </p>

I tried adjusting the number of operator buttons, adding items to remove or change desired blocks,<br>
<br>
adjusting effects for design purposes in advance, and I created various prototypes regarding the layout of the UI and the game progression.<br>
<br>
But of course, the most important thing was the initial planning intention of 'learning easily while playing through familiarity',<br>
<br>
so I gradually designed it to be easy and naturally playable by anyone, excluding complex and difficult parts as much as possible.<br>
<br>
In fact, even after finishing the development, I still regret removing the part where I match decimal and binary blocks and the part with block change items.<br>
<br>
However, I'm satisfied that I ended up creating a game that can be played without being overly complex. <br>
<br><br><br>

## Development

### Client
The client development was carried out with Unity. <br>
<br>
Initially, I had two choices of commercial engines, Unreal Engine and Unity. At that time, <br>
<br>
I was more familiar with C++ than C#, but... <br>
<br><br>
1. Due to the fact that I was developing alone<br>
2. The game is to be released on mobile<br>
<br><br>

I chose Unity, which has a relatively more active 'Asset Store' and community, and is friendly to mobile.<br>
<br>
At the beginning of the project development, mentor [Jongpil Kim](https://github.com/jongfeel)'s help with handling Unity was incredibly helpful.<br>
<br>
Actually, I was really thankful not only for Unity, but also for guidance on the direction of the project, issue management, and most importantly, for the emotional support in many ways.<br>
<br>
I sincerely thank him again and again.<br>
<br><br><br>
The client development itself was really fun. <br>
<br>
Being able to implement exactly what I want and see it directly is the big charm of client development.<br>
<br>
Moreover, since I was also planning, the fun seemed to double.<br>
<br>
However, there are some regrettable parts when I think about it now because I developed it while studying design patterns and the C# language...<br>
<br>
particularly, abusing the singleton pattern too much, and unnecessarily inheriting and overriding when doing object-oriented programming (based on current thinking).<br><br><br>
Also, when using external plugins during development, dependency issues between plugins often occurred, which were really difficult and frustrating to solve.<br>
<br>
But I thought that if I just sat down and searched for something, typed some code, and tried it, it would move forward. So I just sat down and did something.<br>
<br>
It may be a bit of a brute force approach, but I kept reassuring myself and continued to make gradual progress by sitting, searching, and modifying code.<br>
<br><br><br>
Another challenging part was the issue of mobile optimization.<br>
<br>
When I inserted flashy effects and cool animations, they worked really well on PC, <br>
<br>
but on mobile, there were issues such as overheating and stuttering when the C# garbage collector was running. <br>
<br>
In such cases, I checked and corrected the popping parts using the Unity profiler,  <br>
<br>
and proceeded with optimization through resolution and frame-related optimization settings, and lectures by Unity evangelists.<br>
<br><br><br>
The disappointment when my cool project, developed hard on PC, ended up rapidly draining the battery by turning into a hot hand warmer on mobile is really indescribable. <br>
<br>
However, the joy when I first played my game running well on mobile after learning and applying various optimization techniques was also indescribable. <br>
<br>
Optimization is one of the very important yet difficult aspects in mobile game development.<br>
<br>
In addition, I encountered and learned about various problems while developing, such as issues related to different resolutions across mobile devices, branching of settings values between Android and iOS.<br>
<br><br><br>
> After the project launch, I plan to gradually library the optimization techniques I used and post them on GitHub,  <br>
<br>
 and I plan to post well-organized issues and error resolution situations related to other optimization and Unity settings on my blog.<br>

<br><br><br>
### Resource
In fact, I used to work as a game business PM. <br>
<br>
The role of a game business PM is not about the fun of the game, <br>
<br>
but rather about setting up a business model, planning, and progressing projects under the KPI of 'How can we make more money from this game?'. <br>
<br>
Also, being a PM in a business team often requires frequent communication with the development team. <br>
<br>
At that time, I understood concepts related to resource management, such as sprite atlas, batching, and draw calls, which I heard through the grapevine. <br>
<br>
I think this served as a good foundation for this development.<br>
<br>
I tried to make the sprites into atlases, and I managed the resources while studying a little more, not just the concepts I knew.<br>
<br>
However, there were some disappointing aspects as I studied.<br>
<br>
For example, Unity has a setting that automatically atlases all sprites. <br>
<br>
You just need to check one option.<br>
<br><br><br>
For art resources, I was initially at a level where I couldn't even draw a good circle or square,<br>
<br>
But gradually I improved and at some point, I was able to make icons and animations at a reasonable level.<br>
<br>
<br>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/images/slide_res/Design_UI_001.png" align="center" width="30%">
    <img src="/assets/images/slide_res/Design_002.png" align="center" width="30%">
    <img src="/assets/images/slide_res/Design_003.png" align="center" width="30%">
    <figcaption align="center">Fun arts!</figcaption>
  </p>
<br><br><br>
Knowing that I am not yet capable of drawing sophisticated and cool arts, <br>
<br>
I deliberately set the game art concept to give a bit of a scribble feel. <br>
<br>
I set it to feel like a primary school student taking notes while studying.<br>

---
<br><br><br>
### Server
For the server, I used Firebase. <br>
<br>
What I wanted was just to store the nicknames and highest scores of users on the server, <br>
<br>
to load the ranking for each user, so I didn't implement my own server.<br>
<br>
In addition, it was attractive that Unity and Firebase are very compatible based on Android. <br>
<br>
> As of July 2023, there is a compatibility issue between Firebase SDK, cocoapods, and ruby on iOS M2.<br>

<br>
Unity and Firebase are designed to be easily connected, <br>
<br>
Once you study and understand the basic concepts, you can easily develop them.<br>
<br>
In fact, because they are simple features, it is insufficient to call it a game server,<br>
<br>
I am very happy to have created my own game that directly connects the client and the server and updates user information.<br>
<br><br><br>
Also, user login is done through Google Play Games Service on Android,<br>
<br>
On iOS, it is done through the Game Center.<br>
<br>
If the user is not connected to the network or cannot use the two platforms,<br>
<br>
After identifying user information on the client, a unique UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is generated using the C# Guid class, registered on the server, and able to send and receive requests.<br>

<br><br><br>
## BM
In fact, it was not easy to set a BM as the game was intended for production experience and educational purposes.<br>
<br>
If ads keep coming out in educational games or if it induces gacha...<br>
<br>
Therefore, I set up a BM to encourage sponsorship with simple reward ads and IAP. <br>
<br>

---
<br><br><br>
## Localization
The languages supported by the game are Korean, English, and French. <br>
<br>
There was no problem with localization in Korean and English, but French was a bit tricky.<br>
<br>
Even with English, if you use an internet translator, many awkward sentences come out, <br>
<br>
Because I don't know French at all, if I use a translator, I can't even tell if there is a wrong sentence.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I proceeded with localization while communicating with a friend who is fluent in French.<br>

<br><br><br>

---
<br><br><br>
## Market Management
This greatly helped me as I worked as a game business PM. <br>
<br>
Privacy policy, terms of service, ad restrictions for children under 14, market targets, etc.,<br>
<br>
Based on the experience of solving various issues that I encountered during my work, I was able to solve them familiarly.<br>
<br><br><br>

---
And finally, on July 15, 2023, I released BOB - Basis Of Bitwise.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
 It was a fun journey.<br>
<br><br><br>

## Closing
I will post my experience on solving issues, code, Unity settings, etc. during the development stage on the blog in the future.<br>
<br>
I also plan to write a review after the live service.<br>
<br>
Thank you for reading the long post.<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoyed it.<br>
<br>
Thank you to everyone who played and read the reviews.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
